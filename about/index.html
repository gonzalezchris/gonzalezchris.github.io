    		<h2>About Me</h2>

  		  <p>
          My favorite thing to do is to learn. I enjoy learning and reading about random bits of information, whether it relates to software development, undiscovered treasures I'm game :).
          I especially love learning about the cosmos, thinking about the known unknowns and wondering about the unknown unknowns. Contemplating human origins and history is something I
          constantly do, why are we the way we are? Where did we come from? An excellent book on the top is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095">Sapiens: A Brief History Of Mankind</a>
          by Yuval Noah Harari. It really puts into perspective humanity's precense on this planet, and how far we've come in a short time period.

          Recently, I've been experimenting with blockchain technology, specifically on the Ethereum platform.
          According to one of the most influential crypto experts out there, <a href="https://github.com/aantonop">Andreas M. Antonopoulos</a>, currently blockchain is equivalent to where the web was in 1992, with the hype of the web in 1998.
          Although there is tons of hype, I still believe in the tech, and thus have been playing around with smart contracts.
          Creating smart contracts has been a blast so far, and I'm planning on building something really
          cool, really soon! If you're interested in collaborating on a project let me know.
        </p>

  		  <!-- <h2>Interests</h2>

        <p>
          I love collaborative building, good food (especially hummus), socializing, hiking, biking, listening to music and traveling as much as I can.
        </p>

        <p>
          Technically, I love iOS development and everything around it. You can find me watching WWDC videos in my free time or creating prototypes. Every day, I'm learning how to better build elegant, scalable and technologically-focused solutions.
